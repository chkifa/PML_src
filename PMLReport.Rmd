# Training set splitting
# Removing predictors with NA values
# Removing all the not meaningful predictors
# Multicollinearity
# Preprocessing (center and scale, ROC)
# Fit the models (different models, why the random forest, why the chosen params, why and what cross-validation)
# Prediction and confusion matrix (Testing part dataset and expected out of sample error)
# Execution on the final testing dataset

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
